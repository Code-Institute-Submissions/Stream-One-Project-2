<p>The above map is the route taken for the cruise. It lasted 10 days leaving Puerto Rico and returning to the starting off point. On the map the islands appear to be very close together, you expect to see the next on the horizon. This was not the case, they were all over the horizon. As you progressed through the Caribean Sea one did pass some islands where we did not stop at, some appeared to be uninhabited, all had lush vegetation.</p>
